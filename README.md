# EzyPay Subscription Module
This project consists of Spring Boot API backend and Angular 8 frontend.

To run the project, run 'gradlew bootRun' at CMD. You can view the frontend at 'http://localhost:8049' after gradle run as I have already included the build file of Angular frontend in the source code.

The Angular source code is located at 'src/main/webapp/frontend/' of the project. To start the frontend separately, run 'npm install' and then 'ng serve' for at the frontend folder.

I also added 2 JUnit test case at SubscriptionControllerTest.java at 'src/test/java/com/ezypay/controller/test' folder.
